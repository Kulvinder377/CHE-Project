        <h2>Global Temperature Trends</h2>
        <p>
          Global temperature trends reflect the profound impact of climate
          change on the Earth’s environment. Over the last century, average
          temperatures have risen significantly, mainly due to human activities
          such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.
          This increase has been accompanied by more frequent extreme weather
          events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems.
          Understanding these trends is crucial for predicting future climate
          scenarios and developing effective strategies for mitigation and
          adaptation. The following graph illustrates the global average
          temperature rise from 2000 to 2020, highlighting key milestones in
          climate policy and natural events that have contributed to these
          changes.

        <h2>Indian Temperature Trends</h2>
        <p>
          India, with its diverse climate zones, has experienced significant
          temperature fluctuations over the years. The Indian subcontinent has
          been warming at an alarming rate, impacting agriculture, water
          resources, and public health. Increased temperatures have led to
          severe droughts in some regions and flooding in others, disrupting the
          livelihoods of millions. In recent years, heatwaves have become more
          common, prompting concerns about heat-related illnesses and mortality.
          This section presents a detailed analysis of temperature trends in
          India, showcasing how climate change affects this densely populated
          country.

        <h2>Temperature Data Comparison</h2>
        <p>
          The table below provides a comparative view of temperature trends over
          the years in both global and Indian contexts. It highlights the
          average temperatures recorded each year along with notable climatic
          events that have influenced these figures. This comparative analysis
          serves to emphasize the urgent need for climate action, as the effects
          of rising temperatures are felt worldwide but manifest differently in
          various regions.

        <h2>Impact Photos</h2>
        <p>
          Photographic evidence of temperature-related impacts provides a
          visceral understanding of climate change effects. Images capturing
          heatwaves, droughts, floods, and melting glaciers serve as powerful
          reminders of the urgent need to address global warming. This gallery
          includes various scenarios, showcasing how temperature changes have
          affected ecosystems and human communities. By engaging with these
          images, we hope to foster a greater awareness of climate change and
          inspire action to mitigate its effects.
