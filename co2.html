        <h2>Global CO2 Levels</h2>
        <p>
          Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a significant greenhouse gas that plays a
          crucial role in climate change. Over the past century, global CO2
          levels have increased dramatically due to human activities, including
          burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This
          rise in CO2 concentrations has led to an enhanced greenhouse effect,
          resulting in global warming and extreme weather events. Monitoring
          atmospheric CO2 levels is essential for understanding climate dynamics
          and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The
          following graph illustrates the global average CO2 levels from 2000 to
          2020, highlighting the trend of increasing concentrations and its
          implications for the environment.

        <h2>Indian CO2 Levels</h2>
        <p>
          India is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, primarily due
          to its reliance on coal for energy production, rapid
          industrialization, and urbanization. The increasing CO2 levels in
          India have significant consequences for air quality and public health,
          as well as contributing to global climate change. Urban areas
          experience much higher CO2 concentrations due to vehicular emissions
          and industrial activities. Monitoring CO2 levels is vital for
          developing effective policies aimed at reducing emissions and
          improving air quality. This section presents a graph that showcases
          the CO2 level trends in India from 2000 to 2020, emphasizing the
          urgency of addressing emissions in the country.

        <h2>CO2 Data Comparison</h2>
        <p>
          The table below provides a comparative overview of CO2 levels over the
          years for both global and Indian contexts. It highlights the average
          CO2 concentrations recorded each year along with significant events
          that have influenced these levels. This comparative analysis
          emphasizes the critical need for climate action, as rising CO2 levels
          contribute to global warming and associated environmental impacts.

        <h2>Impact Photos</h2>
        <p>
          The effects of rising CO2 levels can be observed through various
          environmental changes. Photographic evidence of pollution,
          urbanization, and the impact of climate change provides a stark
          reminder of the consequences of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
          This gallery showcases images that highlight air pollution in urban
          areas, industrial emissions, and environmental degradation. By
          observing these impacts, we hope to raise awareness about the urgent
          need to combat CO2 emissions and promote sustainable practices.
