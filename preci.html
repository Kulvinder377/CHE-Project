        <h2>Global Precipitation Levels</h2>
        <p>
          Precipitation is a crucial component of the Earth's climate system. It
          includes all forms of water, liquid or solid, that falls from the
          atmosphere to the surface of the Earth. Over the years, global
          precipitation patterns have been influenced by climate change, with
          some regions experiencing increased rainfall while others face severe
          droughts. The impacts of these changes are significant, affecting
          agriculture, water resources, and ecosystems. The following graph
          illustrates the trend of average global precipitation from 2000 to
          2020, highlighting fluctuations and the overall increase in extreme
          weather events.

        <h2>Indian Precipitation Levels</h2>
        <p>
          India experiences a diverse range of precipitation levels due to its
          varied geography and monsoon climate. The Indian monsoon is a critical
          weather system that brings heavy rainfall to the country, especially
          during the summer months. However, recent years have shown shifts in
          precipitation patterns, with some areas receiving excessive rainfall
          and others facing shortages. These changes pose challenges for
          agriculture, water supply, and disaster management. The following
          graph presents the trend of average annual precipitation in India from
          2000 to 2020, emphasizing the variability and importance of
          understanding these patterns for future planning.

        <h2>Precipitation Data Comparison</h2>
        <p>
          The table below offers a comparative overview of average annual
          precipitation levels for global and Indian contexts from 2000 to 2020.
          It highlights the differences in precipitation patterns alongside
          notable climatic events that may have influenced these trends.
          Understanding these comparisons is vital for policymakers and
          researchers as they work to address the challenges posed by changing
          precipitation levels.

        <h2>Impact Photos</h2>
        <p>
          The effects of precipitation levels are visible in various ways, from
          agricultural impacts to flooding. This gallery showcases images that
          illustrate the consequences of changing precipitation patterns,
          highlighting both the positive aspects, such as thriving crops, and
          the negative impacts, such as flooding and water scarcity. By
          observing these impacts, we hope to raise awareness about the
          importance of monitoring and understanding precipitation levels in
          relation to climate change.
